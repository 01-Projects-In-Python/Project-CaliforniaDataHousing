a. Purpose:

Using the California Housing Dataset, build a Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with specific penalty parameters and compare its accuracy with a Linear Regression model.

b. Objectives:

1. Read the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Feature selection.
4. Using K-cross validation with K as 5, building 3 linear regression models and comparing their performance:
- First model: Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a penalty of 'Elastic Net'.
- Second model: Linear Regression model with Stochastic Gradient Descent with a penalty of 'Ridge Regression'.
- Third model: Ordinaty Linear Regression model.
